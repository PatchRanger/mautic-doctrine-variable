# mautic-doctrine-variable
Sets Doctrine session variables.

# Installation
- Copy `DoctrineVariableBundle` folder into your `plugins` directory.
- Go to `<your mautic>/s/plugins` .
- Click on the "Install/Upgrade plugins" in the top right corner.
- Click on `Doctrine Variable`.
- Now you're able to configure Doctrine session variables - though you need to directly edit `EventListener/DoctrineSubscriber.php` for that purpose.
